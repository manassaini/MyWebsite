# MyWebsite
My portfolio website, 2021

One day, I googled "Good computer science projects to do". There were many articles, videos, and ideas to my very open-ended question. However, nothing stood out to me more than "build your own website". I thought a website would be a good project for several reasons. First, it is good for a computer science student to have a personal portfolio. And second, it also serves as a project that you can show off on GitHub and your resume. However, the idea of building an entire website seemed very daunting at first. I had no experience with the front end and had never used HTML or CSS. But I thought to myself, what is a better time to start than right now? So the task began.

I spent hours and hours learning the very basics of HTML and CSS. I watched countless videos just to get the basics down. I practiced with very premature projects just to get a feel of it. I also used helpful online documentation for HTML and CSS such as W3Schools.com. To my amazement, learning the basics of web development wasn't difficult at all. I got a hold of the basics easily and felt good about myself. Of course, this is just the basics and I have plenty more to learn (which I will cover below) but I had a good sense of the basics of HTML and CSS and was ready to build my own website! Which turned out great.

Features
-Home section: a simple landing page that has links to all my different profiles
-About Me section: gives a little information about myself and my passion for computer science and software development
-Experiences section: gives my past employment experience (similar to resume)
-Skills section: lists my top skills and what I can bring to any company 
-Projects section: my notable projects that I worked hard on. Hope to have 3 projects by the end of summer '21
-Responsiveness: available on mobile, desktop, and various other screen sizes. I incorporated this using media queries in CSS
-Clickable navbar: You can easily navigate my website with the navbar, which lists all the different sections

My next steps are to learn more about HTML and CSS. I have to dive into semantic tags in HTML and flexbox in CSS. I used some flexbox in this project but had to look online for help. Doing a deeper dive into these technologies will help me make other websites easily. Speaking of this, I would like to make other websites for different businesses. Such as building a website for my tennis camp I run every summer. That would be a very nice addition to our business, as well as another project to show off. In addition, I would also like to upgrade SEWA international's website. This is a non-profit I am a big part of and it would help them out. This would mean I would take part as a freelance web developer, which stands out.

Project Scope: 1 month, 900+ lines of code, 60 commits (subject to change as I update)
